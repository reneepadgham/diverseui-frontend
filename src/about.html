    <h4>
      Diverse UI is a free set of user images that can be used in personal or commercial projects.
      <br><br>
      We built Diverse UI because who we assume our users are, and how we represent that in our visuals, affects who those users turn out to be.
      We want those users to be diverse.
      For more information, we wrote <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/techs-diversity-problem-isn-t-only-in-the-hiring-numbers-edf00f7b5e95" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about why we think diversity in UI mockups is important.

      <b>For v2 - we're using Facebook auth which will make it easier to get more images with better demographic information.</b>
      <br><br>
      In the meantime, some of the v1 database will remain - which we admit isn't perfect. We avoided caricatures, but that doesnâ€™t mean some images donâ€™t feel a bit exaggerated, staged, or professional.
      We didnâ€™t have a good way to recognize or account for preferred gender representation. In fact, <a href="/submit.html">submitting your photo</a> is one of the best ways to help out.
      You can help us make the most awesome set of real people on the internet.
